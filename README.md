# Network Modeling and Simulation Project
Repository for the final project of the course of Network Modeling and Simulation, prof. Marchetti, done by Alessia Guadagnin Pattaro, Giovanni Plazzotta, and Annarita Zanon. 
Master of Science in Quantitative and Computational Biology, A. A. 2022-2023

## Paper: Validation of a Mathematical Model Describing the Dynamics of Chemotherapy for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia In Vivo, Guzev _et al._

## Structure of the repository

* `report-latex`: folder with report written in LaTeX `report-latex`
* `sim_data`: folder with simulation data `sim_data`
* MATLAB code (`model_trt.m`, `model_1_trt.m`, `model_no_treatment.m`)

## Structure of the project

* Introduction: what is CLL
* Materials and methods: focus on the two drugs and their mode of action, experimental setup used on the paper
* Results presented in the paper, including revised calculations of the mathematical model, of the stability analysis, and of parameter estimation
* Results of the simulations obtained by the students
* Conclusions
