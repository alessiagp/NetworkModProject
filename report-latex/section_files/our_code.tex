The deterministic simulations presented in the paper were replicated by using the MATLAB suite \texttt{ode45}. This library, dedicated to solve systems of differential equations in the form $y'=f(t,y)$, implemnts an adaptive-step Runge-Kutta integration algorithm of the fourth-order. 
We developed the following script to solve the system of equation (1), (2), (3) for each treatment condition.
