The deterministic simulations presented in the paper were replicated by using MATLAB and the library \texttt{ode45}. This library is dedicated to solve systems of differential equations in the form $y'=f(t,y)$ and is based on an explicit Runge-Kutta 45 algorithm. 
Three different algorithms were developed:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A model without treatment, replicating the system of differential equations (A1), (A2), (A3)
	\item A model with dosage of 62.5 mg/kg of Cyt
	\item Another model with dosage of
\end{enumerate}
