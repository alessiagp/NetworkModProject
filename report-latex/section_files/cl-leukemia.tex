The paper under analysis sets itself the aim of building a mathematical model to describe the interaction between malignant chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells, drug molecules and effector cells, mainly NK cells (innate immunity) and T CD8 lymphocytes (adaptive immunity) in the case of cancer response.
The dosage regimens reported in the paper use two different drugs, the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor Ibrutinib (Ibr) and an inhibitor of the DNA polymerase enzyme, Cytarabine (Cyt), whose introduction has transformed therapy and contributed to extending the overall survival of patients. 
Additional details about these small-molecule drugs will be presented in the sections below. While the formulation of a mathematical model describing the dynamics of cancer in an immunoreactive environment is not innovative \textit{per se}, this paper sets itself apart in the sense that:
\begin{itemize}
\item It deals with a blood cancer instead of a solid tumour: in blood cancers, cell growth, survival dynamics and cellular interactions within the tumour microenvironment likely differ considerably from solid tumours. It is expected that several parameters of previously formulated ODE-based models need to be adapted for blood-borne cancers.
\item The majority of models use data generated by simulations to perform the parameter estimation, instead of experimental data. This paper, on the other hand, is strongly experimentally - oriented.
\item When data are derived from experiments, these are often performed \textit{in vitro} rather than \textit{in vivo}, and many studies have demonstrated conflicting results, in particular for what concerns optimal drug doses, between these two approaches. This paper describes \textit{in vivo} experiments, performed on murine models injected with A20 CLL cells, aimed at estimating the cancer cells growth rate $r$ and of the cytotoxicity rates $\mu_{AC}$ as a function of therapy. \par

\subsection{Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia}
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common type of blood cancer in adults in the Western world, with an incidence of 4.9 cases in 100000 people per year. It typically occurs in elderly patients, with the median age at diagnosis being 70 years. CLL is characterized by the clonal proliferation and accumulation of mature B lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid organs, spleen, peripheral blood, and bone marrow. \cite{cll-burger-med, cll-rozman-med}  There is no known cause for this disease, but it is suspected to have a genetic component. Loss or addition of large chromosomal material followed by additional mutations, that render the leukaemia increasingly aggressive, are often observed. Additionally, mutations in \textit{IGHV} (immunoglobulin heavy variable) genes distinguishing different types of clinical behaviours of CLL and are prognostic of patent outcome \cite{immunogl-med}. \par

Different treatment strategies are available for patients suffering from CLL. It is important to notice that studies on early-stage disease failed to show the benefit of early therapeutic interventions: treatment of patients with early-stage CLL did not result in a survival benefit. For this reason, and not to fruitlessly trigger the development of drug resistance, patients in these stages should not be treated, but only monitored, until the disease becomes \textit{active}. The degree of \textit{activity} of CLL can be assessed using the following guidelines:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of $\geq 50 \%$ over 2 months, or lymphocyte doubling time $\leq 6$ months.
    \item Worsening of anaemia and/or thrombocytopenia
    \item Massive nodes (i.e., $\geq 10$ cm in longest diameter)
    \item Massive or symptomatic splenomegaly and hepatomegaly
    \item Autoimmune complications
    \item Functional extranodal involvement (e.g., skin, kidney, lung, spine)
    \item Significant weight loss and fatigue, fevers above 38 degrees for more than two weeks, night sweats. 
\end{itemize}
When the treatment becomes necessary, specialists can choose between different classes of drugs targeting different aspects of the cellular structure (e.g. surface antibodies), metabolism, and external microenvironment:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Cytostatic agents}: their goal is to stop cellular proliferation by interfering with the replication process. Examples are purine analogues, such as Cytarabine (Cyt).
	\item \textbf{Monoclonal Antibodies}: specifically built to interact with surface antigens that have been documented to be overexpressed in malignancies, like CD-20 and CD-52 receptors in B-cells blood cancers. They have the goal of guiding the immune system towards the cancerous cells. Examples are Rituximab and Alemtuzumab.
	\item \textbf{Signalling-targeting agents}: having the goal of interfering with the embedded signalling pathways to trigger apoptosis. Ibrutinib (Ibr), the second drug discussed in this presentation, is a Bruton Tyrosine Kinase inhibitor that hinders the downstream propagation of the signal generated by bounded BCR receptors, stopping the activation of B cells' survival pathways. 
	\item \textbf{Immunotherapy}: different CART approaches are being explored.
\end{itemize} \par

Finally, a worth noting characteristic of CLL is its incurability, at least for patients who do not undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation. This is due to the very low level of clonality displayed by the majority of somatic \textit{passenger} mutations that accumulate above the background of \textit{driver} mutations that originally gave birth to the malignancy. A very low level of clonality implies a very high tumour heterogeneity, with different subpopulations carrying different sets of mutations, and in turn, a very high tumour heterogeneity increases the probability of developing primary resistance. \par
